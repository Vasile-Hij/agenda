Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer 
programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. 
An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

OOP Principles
* Abstraction - to simplify the reality and focus only on the data and process relevant to the application being built 
* Encapsulation - in a separate class, privately held inside a defined boundary or class
* Inheritance - relationships and subclasses between objects can be assigned, allowing 
                developers to reuse common logic while still maintaining a unique hierarchy.
* Polymorphism - objects can take on more than one form depending on the context.
